* Load test variables from config.yml
* Duplicate host file system for testing in isolation
	* OverlayFS works quite well, but I'm not sure you can mount a folder as root 
		with LXC
	* Docker's standard image creation creates it from a tarball, so you would have
		to dupe the whole file system to get that. 
	* It might be possible to craft a container for LXC to run, but I think it will
		depend on what storage driver it is using, and there is a lot of modification
		that must be done first to make it work in a container

* Running exploit hook on remote target
* Move to reading script for running hook
* Auto fetch and check signature for source files
* Pick docker names to allow concurent tests
