Some exploits to test

Buffer-overflow

  These are blocked by CFI flag, and sometimes by ASAN (address sanitizer)

  NTP BufferOverflow

  12.04.5, ntpdc 4.2.6p3

	I have NTPD 4.2.6p3 compiling on an ubuntu 12 image. 
	I am not sure there are modent kernel features preventing the attack.
	The exploit says it can take up to two hours, and I'm not sure how it behaves
		when it fails, I'm letting it run on both new and old versions to see. 
	It may not be possible to detect a failure/do with the current host kernel
	Even so, I will compile with CFI/asan and see if they complain about the exploit.
