Some exploits to test

Buffer-overflow

  These are blocked by CFI flag, and sometimes by ASAN (address sanitizer)

  NTP BufferOverflow
  https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/35732/
  12.04.5, ntpdc 4.2.6p3

	I have NTPD 4.2.6p3 compiling on an ubuntu 12 image. 
	I am not sure there are modern kernel features preventing the attack.
	The exploit says it can take up to two hours, and I'm not sure how it behaves
		when it fails, I'm letting it run on both new and old versions to see. 
	Those runs did not seem to terminate, I have modified the code to print it's
	progress, we will see how it works. I think that it should be possible to 
	eventually return whether the exploit ran. 

  VFU 4.10-1.1 BOF
  https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/35450/
  On debian Wheezy

	There were a number of typos in the exploit file
	I think the shellcode is inteded to simply open bash, but 
		it seems like it just does some really strange things with 
		the colors and drops back to the original shell. 
	I think that it is working, tries to open a shell, and segfaults.
	I have tried with -fno-stack-protector 


  mCrypt 2.5.8 BOF
  https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/22928/
  On Arch 3.6.6-1

	Signal 11 caught for all versions when opening payload file. 
	Compiling with -fno-stack-protector
