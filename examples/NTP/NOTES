Tried exploit, it ran for ~ 30 hours, tried all offsets and failed. 

Went to CVE gist, and compared paxtest/checksec/etc. 

Running `python -c 'print "A"*600' | ntpdc` Segfaults for other guy, but not for me. 

The paxtest reports killed processes for a number of vulnerabilities on my system, but not on the attackers system. 

Trying to run debian 7 i386 in virtualbox

	Paxtests report wide open, hardening check reports vuln, etc. 

	Tried multiple versions of ntpd, including an old package

	Still no Segaults
